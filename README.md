 I have only completed the first task, focusing primarily on the backend. Although I do not have prior experience with frontend development, I made an effort to implement the front end using Blazor due to time constraints. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to dedicate as much time to learning it as I would have liked. Nevertheless, I am submitting the completed task for your review.

 i have added the backend solution and the dbms i have used, also added the front end part that i have done
